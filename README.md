# Group Model spatial analysis repository

 Includes code used for the analyses in Ohlsson & Ekl√∂f.
 
 The analysis requires downloads of: 
 - the original data file `foodwebs.xlsx` from Kortsch *et al.* 2018 (Ecography, https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.k04q2kd)
 - the REVISED taxonomy information file `SpeciesList.txt` from Planque *et al.* 2016 (Wiley Collection, https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3306768.v1)
Both files are to be put in `data/kortsch/`
 
 Summarised GIS-data including environmental data from Kortsch *et al.* 2018 (Ecography) is included in `data/gis/`

`code/` includes our R scripts used for data handling and analyses.

The Group Model from Michalska-Smith *et al.* 2018 (J. Anim. Ecol) is available at https://git.io/vXciH - our results from this step are also included in `results/groups/`
